# Frigate - NVR With Realtime Object Detection for IP Cameras
A complete and local NVR designed for HomeAssistant with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

Use of a [Google Coral Accelerator](https://coral.ai/products/) is optional, but highly recommended. The Coral will outperform even the best CPUs and can process 100+ FPS with very little overhead.

- Tight integration with HomeAssistant via a [custom component](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration)
- Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
- Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
- Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
- Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
- Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
- 24/7 recording
- Re-streaming via RTMP to reduce the number of connections to your camera

## Recommended Hardware

### Cameras
Cameras that output H.264 video and AAC audio will offer the most compatibility with all features of Frigate and HomeAssistant. It is also helpful if your camera supports multiple substreams to allow different resolutions to be used for detection, streaming, clips, and recordings without re-encoding.

### Computer
|Name|Inference Speed|Notes|
|----|---------------|-----|
|Atomic Pi|16ms|Good option for a dedicated low power board with a small number of cameras. Can leverage Intel QuickSync for stream decoding.|
|Intel NUC NUC7i3BNK|8-10ms|Great performance. Can handle many cameras at 5fps depending on typical amounts of motion.|
|BMAX B2 Plus|10-12ms|Good balance of performance and cost. Also capable of running many other services at the same time as frigate.|
|Minisforum GK41|9-10ms|Great alternative to a NUC with dual Gigabit NICs. Easily handles several 1080p cameras.|
|Raspberry Pi 3B (32bit)|60ms|Can handle a small number of cameras, but the detection speeds are slow due to USB 2.0.|
|Raspberry Pi 4 (32bit)|15-20ms|Can handle a small number of cameras. The 2GB version runs fine.|
|Raspberry Pi 4 (64bit)|10-15ms|Can handle a small number of cameras. The 2GB version runs fine.|

## Installing
Frigate is a Docker container that can be run on any Docker host including as a [HassOS Addon](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/). See instructions below for installing the HassOS addon.

For HomeAssistant users, there is also a [custom component (aka integration)](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration). This custom component adds tighter integration with HomeAssistant by automatically setting up camera entities, sensors, media browser for clips and recordings, and a public API to simplify notifications.

Note that HassOS Addons and custom components are different things. If you are already running Frigate with Docker directly, you do not need the Addon since the Addon would run another instance of Frigate.

### HassOS Addon
HassOS users can install via the addon repository. Frigate requires an MQTT server.
1. Navigate to Supervisor > Add-on Store > Repositories
1. Add https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-addons
1. Setup your configuration in the `Configuration` tab
1. Start the addon container

### Docker
Make sure you choose the right image for your architecture:
|Arch|Image Name|
|-|-|
|amd64|blakeblackshear/frigate:stable-amd64|
|amd64nvidia|blakeblackshear/frigate:stable-amd64nvidia|
|armv7|blakeblackshear/frigate:stable-armv7|
|aarch64|blakeblackshear/frigate:stable-aarch64|

It is recommended to run with docker-compose:
```yaml
version: "3.6"
services:
  frigate:
    container_name: frigate
    restart: unless-stopped
    privileged: true
    image: blakeblackshear/frigate:0.8.0-beta2-amd64
    volumes:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - <path_to_config>:/config
      - <path_to_directory_for_clips>:/media/frigate/clips      
      - <path_to_directory_for_recordings>:/media/frigate/recordings      
      - type: tmpfs # Optional: 1GB of memory, reduces SSD/SD Card wear
        target: /tmp/cache
        tmpfs:
          size: 100000000
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
      - "1935:1935" # RTMP feeds
    environment:
      FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD: "password"
```

If you can't use docker compose, you can run the container with something similar to this:
```bash
docker run --rm \
--name frigate \
--privileged \
--mount type=tmpfs,target=/tmp/cache,tmpfs-size=100000000 \
-v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
-v <path_to_directory_for_clips>:/media/frigate/clips \
-v <path_to_directory_for_recordings>:/media/frigate/recordings \
-v <path_to_config>:/config:ro \
-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
-e FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD='password' \
-p 5000:5000 \
-p 1935:1935 \
blakeblackshear/frigate:0.8.0-beta2-amd64
```

### Kubernetes
Use the [helm chart](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/tree/master/charts/frigate).

### Virtualization
For ideal performance, Frigate needs access to underlying hardware for the Coral and GPU devices for ffmpeg decoding. Running Frigate in a VM on top of Proxmox, ESXi, Virtualbox, etc. is not recommended. The virtualization layer typically introduces a sizable amount of overhead for communication with Coral devices.

#### Proxmox
Some people have had success running Frigate in LXC directly with the following config:
```
arch: amd64
cores: 2
features: nesting=1
hostname: FrigateLXC
memory: 4096
net0: name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1,hwaddr=2E:76:AE:5A:58:48,ip=dhcp,ip6=auto,type=veth
ostype: debian
rootfs: local-lvm:vm-115-disk-0,size=12G
swap: 512
lxc.cgroup.devices.allow: c 189:385 rwm
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri/renderD128 dev/dri/renderD128 none bind,optional,create=file
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/bus/usb/004/002 dev/bus/usb/004/002 none bind,optional,create=file
lxc.apparmor.profile: unconfined
lxc.cgroup.devices.allow: a
lxc.cap.drop:
```

### Calculating shm-size
The default shm-size of 64m is fine for setups with 3 or less 1080p cameras. If frigate is exiting with "Bus error" messages, it could be because you have too many high resolution cameras and you need to specify a higher shm size.

You can calculate the necessary shm-size for each camera with the following formula:
```
(width * height * 1.5 * 7 + 270480)/1048576 = <shm size in mb>
```

## Configuration
HassOS users can manage their configuration directly in the addon Configuration tab. For other installations, the default location for the config file is `/config/config.yml`. This can be overridden with the `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable. Camera specific ffmpeg parameters are documented [here](docs/cameras.md).

It is recommended to start with a minimal configuration and add to it:
```yaml

## Setting Up Camera Inputs
Up to 4 inputs can be configured for each camera and the role of each input can be mixed and matched based on your needs. This allows you to use a lower resolution stream for object detection, but create clips from a higher resolution stream, or vice versa.

Each role can only be assigned to one input per camera. The options for roles are as follows:
|Role|Description|
|----|-----|
|`detect`|Main feed for object detection|
|`clips`|Clips of events from objects detected in the `detect` feed. [docs](#recording-clips)|
|`record`|Saves 60 second segments of the video feed. [docs](#247-recordings)|
|`rtmp`|Broadcast as an RTMP feed for other services to consume. [docs](#rtmp-streams)|

Example:
```yaml
mqtt:
  host: mqtt.server.com
cameras:
  back:
    ffmpeg:
      inputs:
        - path: rtsp://viewer:{FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD}@10.0.10.10:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=2
          roles:
            - detect
            - rtmp
        - path: rtsp://viewer:{FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD}@10.0.10.10:554/live
          roles:
            - clips
            - record
    width: 1280
    height: 720
    fps: 5
```

## Optimizing Performance
- **Google Coral**: It is strongly recommended to use a Google Coral, but Frigate will fall back to CPU in the event one is not found. Offloading TensorFlow to the Google Coral is an order of magnitude faster and will reduce your CPU load dramatically. A $60 device will outperform $2000 CPU. Frigate should work with any supported Coral device from https://coral.ai
- **Resolution**: For the `detect` input, choose a camera resolution where the smallest object you want to detect barely fits inside a 300x300px square. The model used by Frigate is trained on 300x300px images, so you will get worse performance and no improvement in accuracy by using a larger resolution since Frigate resizes the area where it is looking for objects to 300x300 anyway.
- **FPS**: 5 frames per second should be adequate. Higher frame rates will require more CPU usage without improving detections or accuracy. Reducing the frame rate on your camera will have the greatest improvement on system resources.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Make sure you configure the `hwaccel_args` for your hardware. They provide a significant reduction in CPU usage if they are available.
- **Masks**: Masks can be used to ignore motion and reduce your idle CPU load. If you have areas with regular motion such as timestamps or trees blowing in the wind, frigate will constantly try to determine if that motion is from a person or other object you are tracking. Those detections not only increase your average CPU usage, but also clog the pipeline for detecting objects elsewhere. If you are experiencing high values for `detection_fps` when no objects of interest are in the cameras, you should use masks to tell frigate to ignore movement from trees, bushes, timestamps, or any part of the image where detections should not be wasted looking for objects.

### FFmpeg Hardware Acceleration
Frigate works on Raspberry Pi 3b/4 and x86 machines. It is recommended to update your configuration to enable hardware accelerated decoding in ffmpeg. Depending on your system, these parameters may not be compatible.

Raspberry Pi 3/4 (32-bit OS)
**NOTICE**: If you are using the addon, ensure you turn off `Protection mode` for hardware acceleration.
```yaml
ffmpeg:
  hwaccel_args:
    - -c:v
    - h264_mmal
```

Raspberry Pi 3/4 (64-bit OS)
**NOTICE**: If you are using the addon, ensure you turn off `Protection mode` for hardware acceleration.
```yaml
ffmpeg:
  hwaccel_args:
    - -c:v
    - h264_v4l2m2m
```

Intel-based CPUs (<10th Generation) via Quicksync (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/QuickSync)
```yaml
ffmpeg:
  hwaccel_args:
    - -hwaccel
    - vaapi
    - -hwaccel_device
    - /dev/dri/renderD128
    - -hwaccel_output_format
    - yuv420p
```

Intel-based CPUs (>=10th Generation) via Quicksync (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/QuickSync)
```yaml
ffmpeg:
  hwaccel_args:
    - -hwaccel
    - qsv
    - -qsv_device

## Detectors
By default Frigate will look for a USB Coral device and fall back to the CPU if it cannot be found. If you have PCI or multiple Coral devices, you need to configure your detector devices in the config file. When using multiple detectors, they run in dedicated processes, but pull from a common queue of requested detections across all cameras.

Frigate supports `edgetpu` and `cpu` as detector types. The device value should be specified according to the [Documentation for the TensorFlow Lite Python API](https://coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/multiple-edgetpu/#using-the-tensorflow-lite-python-api).

**Note**: There is no support for Nvidia GPUs to perform object detection with tensorflow. It can be used for ffmpeg decoding, but not object detection.  

Single USB Coral:
```yaml
detectors:
  coral:
    type: edgetpu
    device: usb
```

Multiple USB Corals:
```yaml
detectors:
  coral1:
    type: edgetpu
    device: usb:0
  coral2:
    type: edgetpu
    device: usb:1
```

Mixing Corals:
```yaml
detectors:
  coral_usb:
    type: edgetpu
    device: usb
  coral_pci:
    type: edgetpu
    device: pci
```

CPU Detectors (not recommended):
```yaml
detectors:
  cpu1:
    type: cpu
  cpu2:
    type: cpu
```

## Reducing False Positives
Tune your object filters to adjust false positives: `min_area`, `max_area`, `min_score`, `threshold`.

For object filters in your configuration, any single detection below `min_score` will be ignored as a false positive. `threshold` is based on the median of the history of scores (padded to 3 values) for a tracked object. Consider the following frames when `min_score` is set to 0.6 and threshold is set to 0.85:

| Frame | Current Score | Score History | Computed Score | Detected Object |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.7 | 0.0, 0, 0.7 | 0.0 | No
| 2 | 0.55 | 0.0, 0.7, 0.0 | 0.0 | No
| 3 | 0.85 | 0.7, 0.0, 0.85 | 0.7 | No
| 4 | 0.90 | 0.7, 0.85, 0.95, 0.90 | 0.875 | Yes
| 5 | 0.88 | 0.7, 0.85, 0.95, 0.90, 0.88 | 0.88 | Yes
| 6 | 0.95 | 0.7, 0.85, 0.95, 0.90, 0.88, 0.95 | 0.89 | Yes

In frame 2, the score is below the `min_score` value, so frigate ignores it and it becomes a 0.0. The computed score is the median of the score history (padding to at least 3 values), and only when that computed score crosses the `threshold` is the object marked as a true positive. That happens in frame 4 in the example.

## Masks
The following types of masks are supported:
- `poly`: (Recommended) List of x,y points like zone configuration
- `base64`: Base64 encoded image file
- `image`: Image file in the `/config` directory

`base64` and `image` masks must be the same aspect ratio and resolution as your camera. 

The mask in the second image would limit motion detection on this camera to only the front yard and not the street. 

<a href="docs/example-mask-check-point.png"><img src="docs/example-mask-check-point.png" height="300"></a>
<a href="docs/example-mask.bmp"><img src="docs/example-mask.bmp" height="300"></a>
<a href="docs/example-mask-overlay.png"><img src="docs/example-mask-overlay.png" height="300"></a>

To create a poly mask:
1. Download a camera snapshot image with the same resolution as the camera feed (`/<camera_name>/latest.jpg`).
1. Upload the image to https://www.image-map.net/
1. Select "shape" poly - start in the lowest left corner and place the first marker (point) and continue upwards and then to the right until the polygon shape covers the area that you want to mask out (ignore). 
1. When you are finished with the polygon click "Show me the code!" and copy all coordinates (point), ie. `"0,461,3,0,1919,0,1919,843,1699,492,1344,458,1346,336,973,317,869,375,866,432"` 
1. Adjust any -1 values to 0 and then add it all to the configuration (see the example configuration for correct indentation and placement)

Example of a finished row corresponding to the below example image:
```yaml
mask: 'poly,0,461,3,0,1919,0,1919,843,1699,492,1344,458,1346,336,973,317,869,375,866,432'
```
    
<a href="docs/example-mask-poly.png"><img src="docs/example-mask-poly.png" height="300"></a>

You can test your mask by temporarily configuring it as a [zone](#zones) and enabling `draw_zones` in your config. Zones are visible on the [MJPEG feed](#camera_name).

[Back to top](#documentation)

## Zones
Zones allow you to define a specific area of the frame and apply additional filters for object types so you can determine whether or not an object is within a particular area. Zones cannot have the same name as a camera. If desired, a single zone can include multiple cameras if you have multiple cameras covering the same area by configuring zones with the same name for each camera.

During testing, `draw_zones` should be set in the config to draw the zone on the frames so you can adjust as needed. The zone line will increase in thickness when any object enters the zone. Zones are visible on the [MJPEG feed](#camera_name).

![Zone Example](docs/zone_example.jpg)

## Recording Clips
**Note**: Previous versions of frigate included `-vsync drop` in input parameters. This is not compatible with FFmpeg's segment feature and must be removed from your input parameters if you have overrides set.

Frigate can save video clips without any CPU overhead for encoding by simply copying the stream directly with FFmpeg. It leverages FFmpeg's segment functionality to maintain a cache of video for each camera. The cache files are written to disk at `/tmp/cache` and do not introduce memory overhead. When an object is being tracked, it will extend the cache to ensure it can assemble a clip when the event ends. Once the event ends, it again uses FFmpeg to assemble a clip by combining the video clips without any encoding by the CPU. Assembled clips are are saved to `/media/frigate/clips`. Clips are retained according to the retention settings defined on the config for each object type.

### Database
Event and clip information is managed in a sqlite database at `/media/frigate/clips/frigate.db`. If that database is deleted, clips will be orphaned and will need to be cleaned up manually. They also won't show up in the Media Browser within HomeAssistant.

If you are storing your clips on a network share (SMB, NFS, etc), you may get a `database is locked` error message on startup. You can customize the location of the database in the config if necessary.

### Global Configuration Options
- `max_seconds`: This limits the size of the cache when an object is being tracked. If an object is stationary and being tracked for a long time, the cache files will expire and this value will be the maximum clip length for the *end* of the event. For example, if this is set to 300 seconds and an object is being tracked for 600 seconds, the clip will end up being the last 300 seconds. Defaults to 300 seconds.

### Per-camera Configuration Options
- `pre_capture`: Defines how much time should be included in the clip prior to the beginning of the event. Defaults to 5 seconds.
- `post_capture`: Defines how much time should be included in the clip after the end of the event. Defaults to 5 seconds.
- `objects`: List of object types to save clips for. Object types here must be listed for tracking at the camera or global configuration. Defaults to all tracked objects.

## 24/7 Recordings
**Note**: Previous versions of frigate included `-vsync drop` in input parameters. This is not compatible with FFmpeg's segment feature and must be removed from your input parameters if you have overrides set.

24/7 recordings can be enabled and are stored at `/media/frigate/recordings`. The folder structure for the recordings is `YYYY-MM/DD/HH/<camera_name>/MM.SS.mp4`. These recordings are written directly from your camera stream without re-encoding and are available in HomeAssistant's media browser. Each camera supports a configurable retention policy in the config.

[Back to top](#documentation)

## RTMP Streams
Frigate can re-stream your video feed as a RTMP feed for other applications such as HomeAssistant to utilize it at `rtmp://<frigate_host>/live/<camera_name>`. Port 1935 must be open. This allows you to use a video feed for detection in frigate and HomeAssistant live view at the same time without having to make two separate connections to the camera. The video feed is copied from the original video feed directly to avoid re-encoding. This feed does not include any annotation by Frigate.

Some video feeds are not compatible with RTMP. If you are experiencing issues, check to make sure your camera feed is h264 with AAC audio. If your camera doesn't support a compatible format for RTMP, you can use the ffmpeg args to re-encode it on the fly at the expense of increased CPU utilization.

## Integration with HomeAssistant
The best way to integrate with HomeAssistant is to use the [official integration](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration). When configuring the integration, you will be asked for the `Host` of your frigate instance. This value should be the url you use to access Frigate in the browser and will look like `http://<host>:5000/`. If you are using HassOS with the addon, the host should be `http://ccab4aaf-frigate:5000` (or `http://ccab4aaf-frigate-beta:5000` if your are using the beta version of the addon). HomeAssistant needs access to port 5000 (api) and 1935 (rtmp) for all features. The integration will setup the following entities within HomeAssistant:

Sensors:
- Stats to monitor frigate performance
- Object counts for all zones and cameras

Cameras:
- Cameras for image of the last detected object for each camera
- Camera entities with stream support (requires RTMP)

Media Browser:
- Rich UI with thumbnails for browsing event clips
- Rich UI for browsing 24/7 recordings by month, day, camera, time

API:
- Notification API with public facing endpoints for images in notifications

### Notifications
Frigate publishes event information in the form of a change feed via MQTT. This allows lots of customization for notifications to meet your needs. Event changes are published with `before` and `after` information as shown [here](#frigateevents).

Here is a simple example of a notification automation of events which will update the existing notification for each change. This means the image you see in the notification will update as frigate finds a "better" image.
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Notify of events
    trigger:
      platform: mqtt
      topic: frigate/events
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_pixel_3
        data_template:
          message: 'A {{trigger.payload_json["after"]["label"]}} was detected.'
          data:
            image: 'https://your.public.hass.address.com/api/frigate/notifications/{{trigger.payload_json["after"]["id"]}}.jpg?format=android'
            tag: '{{trigger.payload_json["after"]["id"]}}'
```
Note that the image url has `?format=android`. This adjusts the aspect ratio to be idea for android notifications. For iOS optimized snapshots, no format parameter needs to be passed.

You can find some additional examples for notifications [here](docs/notification-examples.md).

## HTTP Endpoints
A web server is available on port 5000 with the following endpoints.

### `/<camera_name>`
An mjpeg stream for debugging. Keep in mind the mjpeg endpoint is for debugging only and will put additional load on the system when in use. 

Accepts the following query string parameters:
|param|Type|Description|
|----|-----|--|
|`fps`|int|Frame rate|
|`h`|int|Height in pixels|
|`bbox`|int|Show bounding boxes for detected objects (0 or 1)|
|`timestamp`|int|Print the timestamp in the upper left (0 or 1)|
|`zones`|int|Draw the zones on the image (0 or 1)|
|`mask`|int|Overlay the mask on the image (0 or 1)|
|`motion`|int|Draw blue boxes for areas with detected motion (0 or 1)|
|`regions`|int|Draw green boxes for areas where object detection was run (0 or 1)|

You can access a higher resolution mjpeg stream by appending `h=height-in-pixels` to the endpoint. For example `http://localhost:5000/back?h=1080`. You can also increase the FPS by appending `fps=frame-rate` to the URL such as `http://localhost:5000/back?fps=10` or both with `?fps=10&h=1000`.

### `/<camera_name>/<object_name>/best.jpg[?h=300&crop=1]`
The best snapshot for any object type. It is a full resolution image by default.

Example parameters:
- `h=300`: resizes the image to 300 pixes tall
- `crop=1`: crops the image to the region of the detection rather than returning the entire image

### `/<camera_name>/latest.jpg[?h=300]`
The most recent frame that frigate has finished processing. It is a full resolution image by default.

Accepts the following query string parameters:
|param|Type|Description|
|----|-----|--|
|`h`|int|Height in pixels|
|`bbox`|int|Show bounding boxes for detected objects (0 or 1)|
|`timestamp`|int|Print the timestamp in the upper left (0 or 1)|
|`zones`|int|Draw the zones on the image (0 or 1)|
|`mask`|int|Overlay the mask on the image (0 or 1)|
|`motion`|int|Draw blue boxes for areas with detected motion (0 or 1)|
|`regions`|int|Draw green boxes for areas where object detection was run (0 or 1)|

Example parameters:
- `h=300`: resizes the image to 300 pixes tall

## MQTT Topics
These are the MQTT messages generated by Frigate. The default topic_prefix is `frigate`, but can be changed in the config file.

### `frigate/available`
Designed to be used as an availability topic with HomeAssistant. Possible message are:
"online": published when frigate is running (on startup)
"offline": published right before frigate stops

### `frigate/<camera_name>/<object_name>`
Publishes the count of objects for the camera for use as a sensor in HomeAssistant.

### `frigate/<zone_name>/<object_name>`
Publishes the count of objects for the zone for use as a sensor in HomeAssistant.

### `frigate/<camera_name>/<object_name>/snapshot`
Publishes a jpeg encoded frame of the detected object type. When the object is no longer detected, the highest confidence image is published or the original image
is published again.

The height and crop of snapshots can be configured in the config.

### `frigate/events`
Message published for each changed event. The first message is published when the tracked object is no longer marked as a false_positive. When frigate finds a better snapshot of the tracked object or when a zone change occurs, it will publish a message with the same id. When the event ends, a final message is published with `end_time` set.

## Custom Models
Models for both CPU and EdgeTPU (Coral) are bundled in the image. You can use your own models with volume mounts:
- CPU Model: `/cpu_model.tflite`
- EdgeTPU Model: `/edgetpu_model.tflite`
- Labels: `/labelmap.txt`

You also need to update the model width/height in the config if they differ from the defaults.

### Customizing the Labelmap
The labelmap can be customized to your needs. A common reason to do this is to combine multiple object types that are easily confused when you don't need to be as granular such as car/truck. You must retain the same number of labels, but you can change the names. To change:

- Download the [COCO labelmap](https://dl.google.com/coral/canned_models/coco_labels.txt)
- Modify the label names as desired. For example, change `7 truck` to `7 car`
- Mount the new file at `/labelmap.txt` in the container with an additional volume
  ```
  -v ./config/labelmap.txt:/labelmap.txt
  ```

## Logging
Available log levels are: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`

Examples of available modules are:
- `frigate.app`
- `frigate.mqtt`
- `frigate.edgetpu`
- `frigate.zeroconf`
- `detector.<detector_name>`
- `watchdog.<camera_name>`
- `ffmpeg.<camera_name>.<sorted_roles>` NOTE: All FFmpeg logs are sent as `error` level.

## Troubleshooting

### "[mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2 @ 0x5639eeb6e140] moov atom not found"
These messages in the logs are expected in certain situations. Frigate checks the integrity of the video cache before assembling clips. Occasionally these cached files will be invalid and cleaned up automatically.

### "ffmpeg didnt return a frame. something is wrong"
Turn on logging for the ffmpeg process by overriding the global_args and setting the log level to `info` (the default is `fatal`). Note that all ffmpeg logs show up in the Frigate logs as `ERROR` level. This does not mean they are actually errors.
```yaml
ffmpeg:
  global_args: -hide_banner -loglevel info
```

### "On connect called"
If you see repeated "On connect called" messages in your config, check for another instance of frigate. This happens when multiple frigate containers are trying to connect to mqtt with the same client_id.
