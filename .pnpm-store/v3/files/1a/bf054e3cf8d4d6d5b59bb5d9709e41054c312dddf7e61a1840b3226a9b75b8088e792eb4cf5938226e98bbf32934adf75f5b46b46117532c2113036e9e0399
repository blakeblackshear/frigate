Offers an async require.resolve function. It's highly configurable.

## Features

- plugin system
- provide a custom filesystem
- sync and async node.js filesystems included

## Getting Started

### Install

```sh
# npm
npm install enhanced-resolve
# or Yarn
yarn add enhanced-resolve
```

### Resolve

There is a Node.js API which allows to resolve requests according to the Node.js resolving rules.
Sync and async APIs are offered. A `create` method allows to create a custom resolve function.

```js
const resolve = require("enhanced-resolve");

resolve("/some/path/to/folder", "module/dir", (err, result) => {
	result; // === "/some/path/node_modules/module/dir/index.js"
});

resolve.sync("/some/path/to/folder", "../../dir");
// === "/some/path/dir/index.js"

const myResolve = resolve.create({
	// or resolve.create.sync
	extensions: [".ts", ".js"],
	// see more options below
});

myResolve("/some/path/to/folder", "ts-module", (err, result) => {
	result; // === "/some/node_modules/ts-module/index.ts"
});
```

### Creating a Resolver

The easiest way to create a resolver is to use the `createResolver` function on `ResolveFactory`, along with one of the supplied File System implementations.

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const { CachedInputFileSystem, ResolverFactory } = require("enhanced-resolve");

// create a resolver
const myResolver = ResolverFactory.createResolver({
	// Typical usage will consume the `fs` + `CachedInputFileSystem`, which wraps Node.js `fs` to add caching.
	fileSystem: new CachedInputFileSystem(fs, 4000),
	extensions: [".js", ".json"],
	/* any other resolver options here. Options/defaults can be seen below */
});

// resolve a file with the new resolver
const context = {};
const lookupStartPath = "/Users/webpack/some/root/dir";
const request = "./path/to-look-up.js";
const resolveContext = {};
myResolver.resolve(
	context,
	lookupStartPath,
	request,
	resolveContext,
	(err /* Error */, filepath /* string */) => {
		// Do something with the path
	},
);
```

## Plugins

Similar to `webpack`, the core of `enhanced-resolve` functionality is implemented as individual plugins that are executed using [`tapable`](https://github.com/webpack/tapable).
These plugins can extend the functionality of the library, adding other ways for files/contexts to be resolved.

A plugin should be a `class` (or its ES5 equivalent) with an `apply` method. The `apply` method will receive a `resolver` instance, that can be used to hook in to the event system.

### Plugin Boilerplate

```js
class MyResolverPlugin {
	constructor(source, target) {
		this.source = source;
		this.target = target;
	}

	apply(resolver) {
		const target = resolver.ensureHook(this.target);
		resolver
			.getHook(this.source)
			.tapAsync("MyResolverPlugin", (request, resolveContext, callback) => {
				// Any logic you need to create a new `request` can go here
				resolver.doResolve(target, request, null, resolveContext, callback);
			});
	}
}
```

Plugins are executed in a pipeline, and register which event they should be executed before/after. In the example above, `source` is the name of the event that starts the pipeline, and `target` is what event this plugin should fire, which is what continues the execution of the pipeline. For an example of how these different plugin events create a chain, see `lib/ResolverFactory.js`, in the `//// pipeline ////` section.

## Escaping

It's allowed to escape `#` as `\0#` to avoid parsing it as fragment.

enhanced-resolve will try to resolve requests containing `#` as path and as fragment, so it will automatically figure out if `./some#thing` means `.../some.js#thing` or `.../some#thing.js`. When a `#` is resolved as path it will be escaped in the result. Here: `.../some\0#thing.js`.

## Tests

```sh
yarn test
```

## Passing options from webpack

If you are using `webpack`, and you want to pass custom options to `enhanced-resolve`, the options are passed from the `resolve` key of your webpack configuration e.g.:

```
resolve: {
  extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
  modules: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'), 'node_modules'],
  plugins: [new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin()]
  ...
},
```
