# events [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gozala/events.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Gozala/events)

Algolia's fork of Node's event emitter for all engines.

Specifics:
- v1.1.1-based, as it's much smaller and we don't use the newer features
- builtin type-definitions
- better interop with ESM, while still being cjs

## Install

```
npm install events
```

## Require

```javascript
var EventEmitter = require('events');
```

## Usage

See the [node.js event emitter docs](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html)
