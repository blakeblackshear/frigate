/**
 * Checks if a value has the shape of a WHATWG URL object.
 *
 * Using a symbol or instanceof would not be able to recognize URL objects
 * coming from other implementations (e.g. in Electron), so instead we are
 * checking some well known properties for a lack of a better test.
 *
 * We use `href` and `protocol` as they are the only properties that are
 * easy to retrieve and calculate due to the lazy nature of the getters.
 *
 * We check for auth attribute to distinguish legacy url instance with
 * WHATWG URL instance.
 *
 * @param {unknown} fileUrlOrPath
 *   File path or URL.
 * @returns {fileUrlOrPath is URL}
 *   Whether itâ€™s a URL.
