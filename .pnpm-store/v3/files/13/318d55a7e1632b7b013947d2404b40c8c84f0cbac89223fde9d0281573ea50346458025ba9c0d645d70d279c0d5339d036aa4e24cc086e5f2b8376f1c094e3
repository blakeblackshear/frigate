# Style Order for Prettier

__Style Order__ is a [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) plugin which sorts property declarations and groups related properties.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -D prettier-plugin-style-order
```

That's it! Prettier should automatically find/use the plugin.

If it doesn't seem to be working, refer to Prettier's [plugin docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/plugins.html) for more in-depth directions.
