# Suggest using `test.todo` (`prefer-todo`)

ðŸ”§ This rule is automatically fixable by the
[`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

When test cases are empty then it is better to mark them as `test.todo` as it
will be highlighted in the summary output.

## Rule details

This rule triggers a warning if empty test cases are used without 'test.todo'.

```js
test('i need to write this test');
```

The following pattern is considered warning:

```js
test('i need to write this test'); // Unimplemented test case
test('i need to write this test', () => {}); // Empty test case body
test.skip('i need to write this test', () => {}); // Empty test case body
```

The following pattern is not warning:

```js
test.todo('i need to write this test');
```
