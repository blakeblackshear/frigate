### 0.7.4 / 2020-05-22

- Avoid crashing if `process.version` does not contain any digits
- Emit `ping` and `pong` events from the `Server` driver
- Require http-parser-js >=0.5.1 which fixes the bug we addressed in 0.7.3

### 0.7.3 / 2019-06-13

- Cap version of http-parser-js below 0.4.11, which introduced a bug that
  prevents us from handling messages that are part of the same input buffer as
  the handshake response if chunked encoding is specified

### 0.7.2 / 2019-06-13

(This version was pulled due to an error when publishing)

### 0.7.1 / 2019-06-10

- Catch any exceptions produced while generating a handshake response and send a
  `400 Bad Request` response to the client
- Pick the RFC-6455 protocol version if the request contains any of the headers
  used by that version
- Use the `Buffer.alloc()` and `Buffer.from()` functions instead of the unsafe
  `Buffer()` constructor
- Handle errors encountered while handling malformed draft-76 requests
- Change license from MIT to Apache 2.0

### 0.7.0 / 2017-09-11

- Add `ping` and `pong` to the set of events users can listen to
- Replace the bindings to Node's HTTP parser with `http-parser-js`

### 0.6.5 / 2016-05-20

- Don't mutate buffers passed in by the application when masking

### 0.6.4 / 2016-01-07

- If a number is given as input for a frame payload, send it as a string

### 0.6.3 / 2015-11-06

- Reject draft-76 handshakes if their Sec-WebSocket-Key headers are invalid
- Throw a more helpful error if a client is created with an invalid URL

### 0.6.2 / 2015-07-18

- When the peer sends a close frame with no error code, emit 1000

### 0.6.1 / 2015-07-13

- Use the `buffer.{read,write}UInt{16,32}BE` methods for reading/writing numbers
  to buffers rather than including duplicate logic for this

### 0.6.0 / 2015-07-08

- Allow the parser to recover cleanly if event listeners raise an error
- Add a `pong` method for sending unsolicited pong frames

### 0.5.4 / 2015-03-29

- Don't emit extra close frames if we receive a close frame after we already
  sent one
- Fail the connection when the driver receives an invalid
  `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header

### 0.5.3 / 2015-02-22

- Don't treat incoming data as WebSocket frames if a client driver is closed
  before receiving the server handshake

### 0.5.2 / 2015-02-19

- Fix compatibility with the HTTP parser on io.js
- Use `websocket-extensions` to make sure messages and close frames are kept in
  order
- Don't emit multiple `error` events

### 0.5.1 / 2014-12-18

- Don't allow drivers to be created with unrecognized options

### 0.5.0 / 2014-12-13

- Support protocol extensions via the websocket-extensions module

### 0.4.0 / 2014-11-08

- Support connection via HTTP proxies using `CONNECT`

### 0.3.6 / 2014-10-04

- It is now possible to call `close()` before `start()` and close the driver

### 0.3.5 / 2014-07-06

- Don't hold references to frame buffers after a message has been emitted
- Make sure that `protocol` and `version` are exposed properly by the TCP driver

### 0.3.4 / 2014-05-08

- Don't hold memory-leaking references to I/O buffers after they have been
  parsed

### 0.3.3 / 2014-04-24

- Correct the draft-76 status line reason phrase

### 0.3.2 / 2013-12-29

- Expand `maxLength` to cover sequences of continuation frames and
  `draft-{75,76}`
- Decrease default maximum frame buffer size to 64MB
- Stop parsing when the protocol enters a failure mode, to save CPU cycles

### 0.3.1 / 2013-12-03

- Add a `maxLength` option to limit allowed frame size
- Don't pre-allocate a message buffer until the whole frame has arrived
- Fix compatibility with Node v0.11 `HTTPParser`
