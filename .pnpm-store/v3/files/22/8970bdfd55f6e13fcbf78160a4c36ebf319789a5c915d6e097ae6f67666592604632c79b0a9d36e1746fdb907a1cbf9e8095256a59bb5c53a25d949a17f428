## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin to parse a document again.
To understand how it works, requires knowledge of ASTs (specifically, [hast][]).
This plugin passes each node and embedded raw HTML through an HTML parser
([`parse5`][parse5]), to recreate a tree exactly as how a browser would parse
it, while keeping the original data and positional info intact.

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**rehype** adds support for HTML to unified.
**hast** is the HTML AST that rehype uses.
This is a rehype plugin that parses the tree again.

## When should I use this?

This plugin is particularly useful when coming from markdown and wanting to
support HTML embedded inside that markdown (which requires passing
`allowDangerousHtml: true` to `remark-rehype`).
Markdown dictates how, say, a list item or emphasis can be parsed.
We can use that to turn the markdown syntax tree into an HTML syntax tree.
But markdown also dictates that things that look like HTML, are passed through
untouched, even when it just looks like XML but doesn‚Äôt really make sense, so we
can‚Äôt normally use these strings of ‚ÄúHTML‚Äù to create an HTML syntax tree.
This plugin can.
It can be used to take those strings of HTML and include them into the syntax
tree as actual nodes.

If your final result is HTML and you trust content, then ‚Äústrings‚Äù are fine
(you can pass `allowDangerousHtml: true` to `rehype-stringify`, which passes
HTML through untouched).
But there are two main cases where a proper syntax tree is preferred:

*   rehype plugins need a proper syntax tree as they operate on actual nodes to
    inspect or transform things, they can‚Äôt operate on strings of HTML
*   other output formats (React, MDX, etc) need actual nodes and can‚Äôt handle
    strings of HTML

This plugin is built on [`hast-util-raw`][hast-util-raw], which does the work on
syntax trees.
rehype focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting such
internals away.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-raw
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeRaw from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-raw@7'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeRaw from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-raw@7?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following markdown file `example.md`:

```markdown
<div class="note">

A mix of *markdown* and <em>HTML</em>.

</div>
```

‚Ä¶and our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import rehypeDocument from 'rehype-document'
import rehypeFormat from 'rehype-format'
import rehypeRaw from 'rehype-raw'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const file = await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRehype, {allowDangerousHtml: true})
  .use(rehypeRaw)
  .use(rehypeDocument, {title: 'üôå'})
  .use(rehypeFormat)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process(await read('example.md'))

console.log(String(file))
```

‚Ä¶now running `node example.js` yields:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>üôå</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="note">
      <p>A mix of <em>markdown</em> and <em>HTML</em>.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`rehypeRaw`][api-rehype-raw].

### `unified().use(rehypeRaw[, options])`

Parse the tree (and raw nodes) again, keeping positional info okay.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    ‚Äî configuration

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`][transformer]).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

*   `passThrough` (`Array<string>`, default: `[]`)
    ‚Äî list of custom hast node types to pass through (as in, keep); this option
    is a bit advanced as it requires knowledge of ASTs, so we defer to the docs
    in [`hast-util-raw`][hast-util-raw]

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Options`][api-options].

The `Raw` node type is registered by and exposed from
[`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `rehype-raw@^7`, compatible
with Node.js 16.

## Security

The `allowDangerousHtml` option in [`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype] is
dangerous, so see that plugin on how to make it safe.
Otherwise, this plugin is safe.
