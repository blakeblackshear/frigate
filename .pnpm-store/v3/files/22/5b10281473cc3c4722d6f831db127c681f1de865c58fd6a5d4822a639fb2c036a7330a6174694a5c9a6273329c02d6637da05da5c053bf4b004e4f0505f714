For example, if you pass an IncrementFrom value of 2 for the version attribute, but the current value of the attribute is 1, the engine ignores the update. If the object doesn\'t exist, the engine only creates it if you pass an IncrementFrom value of 0. - IncrementSet: increment a numeric integer attribute only if the provided value is greater than the current value, and otherwise ignore the whole object update.
