An empty interface in TypeScript does very little: any non-nullable value is assignable to `{}`.
Using an empty interface is often a sign of programmer error, such as misunderstanding the concept of `{}` or forgetting to fill in fields.

This rule aims to ensure that only meaningful interfaces are declared in the code.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
// an empty interface
interface Foo {}

// an interface with only one supertype (Bar === Foo)
interface Bar extends Foo {}

// an interface with an empty list of supertypes
interface Baz {}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
// an interface with any number of members
interface Foo {
  name: string;
}

// same as above
interface Bar {
  age: number;
}

// an interface with more than one supertype
// in this case the interface can be used as a replacement of an intersection type.
interface Baz extends Foo, Bar {}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

### `allowSingleExtends`

`allowSingleExtends: true` will silence warnings about extending a single interface without adding additional members

## When Not To Use It

If you don't care about having empty/meaningless interfaces, then you will not need this rule.
