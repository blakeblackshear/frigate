# @hapi/hoek

#### Utility methods for the hapi ecosystem.

**hoek** is part of the **hapi** ecosystem and was designed to work seamlessly with the [hapi web framework](https://hapi.dev) and its other components (but works great on its own or with other frameworks). If you are using a different web framework and find this module useful, check out [hapi](https://hapi.dev) â€“ they work even better together.

This module is not intended to solve every problem for everyone, but rather as a central place to store hapi-specific methods. If you're looking for a general purpose utility module, check out [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash).
