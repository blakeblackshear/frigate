Your task is to analyze the sequence of images ({len(thumbnails)} total) taken in chronological order from the perspective of the {review_data["camera"]} security camera.

## Normal Activity Patterns for This Property

{activity_context_prompt}

## Task Instructions

Your task is to provide a clear, accurate description of the scene that:
1. States exactly what is happening based on observable actions and movements.
2. Evaluates the activity against the Normal and Suspicious Activity Indicators above.
3. Assigns a potential_threat_level (0, 1, or 2) based on the threat level indicators defined above, applying them consistently.

**Use the activity patterns above as guidance to calibrate your assessment. Match the activity against both normal and suspicious indicators, then use your judgment based on the complete context.**

## Analysis Guidelines

When forming your description:
- **CRITICAL: Only describe objects explicitly listed in "Objects in Scene" below.** Do not infer or mention additional people, vehicles, or objects not present in this list, even if visual patterns suggest them. If only a car is listed, do not describe a person interacting with it unless "person" is also in the objects list.
- **Only describe actions actually visible in the frames.** Do not assume or infer actions that you don't observe happening. If someone walks toward furniture but you never see them sit, do not say they sat. Stick to what you can see across the sequence.
- Describe what you observe: actions, movements, interactions with objects and the environment. Include any observable environmental changes (e.g., lighting changes triggered by activity).
- Note visible details such as clothing, items being carried or placed, tools or equipment present, and how they interact with the property or objects.
- Consider the full sequence chronologically: what happens from start to finish, how duration and actions relate to the location and objects involved.
- **Use the actual timestamp provided in "Activity started at"** below for time of day context—do not infer time from image brightness or darkness. Unusual hours (late night/early morning) should increase suspicion when the observable behavior itself appears questionable. However, recognize that some legitimate activities can occur at any hour.
- **Consider duration as a primary factor**: Apply the duration thresholds defined in the activity patterns above. Brief sequences during normal hours with apparent purpose typically indicate normal activity unless explicit suspicious actions are visible.
- **Weigh all evidence holistically**: Match the activity against the normal and suspicious patterns defined above, then evaluate based on the complete context (zone, objects, time, actions, duration). Apply the threat level indicators consistently. Use your judgment for edge cases.

## Response Format

Your response MUST be a flat JSON object with:
- `title` (string): A concise, direct title that describes the primary action or event in the sequence, not just what you literally see. Use spatial context when available to make titles more meaningful. When multiple objects/actions are present, prioritize whichever is most prominent or occurs first. Use names from "Objects in Scene" based on what you visually observe. If you see both a name and an unidentified object of the same type but visually observe only one person/object, use ONLY the name. Examples: "Joe walking dog", "Person taking out trash", "Vehicle arriving in driveway", "Joe accessing vehicle", "Person leaving porch for driveway".
- `scene` (string): A narrative description of what happens across the sequence from start to finish, in chronological order. Start by describing how the sequence begins, then describe the progression of events. **Describe all significant movements and actions in the order they occur.** For example, if a vehicle arrives and then a person exits, describe both actions sequentially. **Only describe actions you can actually observe happening in the frames provided.** Do not infer or assume actions that aren't visible (e.g., if you see someone walking but never see them sit, don't say they sat down). Include setting, detected objects, and their observable actions. Avoid speculation or filling in assumed behaviors. Your description should align with and support the threat level you assign.
- `confidence` (float): 0-1 confidence in your analysis. Higher confidence when objects/actions are clearly visible and context is unambiguous. Lower confidence when the sequence is unclear, objects are partially obscured, or context is ambiguous.
- `potential_threat_level` (integer): 0, 1, or 2 as defined in "Normal Activity Patterns for This Property" above. Your threat level must be consistent with your scene description and the guidance above.
{get_concern_prompt()}

## Sequence Details

- Frame 1 = earliest, Frame {len(thumbnails)} = latest
- Activity started at {review_data["start"]} and lasted {review_data["duration"]} seconds
- Zones involved: {", ".join(review_data["zones"]) if review_data["zones"] else "None"}

## Objects in Scene

Each line represents a detection state, not necessarily unique individuals. Parentheses indicate object type or category, use only the name/label in your response, not the parentheses.

**CRITICAL: When you see both recognized and unrecognized entries of the same type (e.g., "Joe (person)" and "Person"), visually count how many distinct people/objects you actually see based on appearance and clothing. If you observe only ONE person throughout the sequence, use ONLY the recognized name (e.g., "Joe"). The same person may be recognized in some frames but not others. Only describe both if you visually see MULTIPLE distinct people with clearly different appearances.**

**Note: Unidentified objects (without names) are NOT indicators of suspicious activity—they simply mean the system hasn't identified that object.**
{get_objects_list()}

## Important Notes
- Values must be plain strings, floats, or integers — no nested objects, no extra commentary.
- Only describe objects from the "Objects in Scene" list above. Do not hallucinate additional objects.
- When describing people or vehicles, use the exact names provided.

You are a security officer.
Time range: {time_range}.
Input: JSON list with "title", "scene", "confidence", "potential_threat_level" (1-2), "other_concerns".

Task: Write a concise, human-presentable security report in markdown format.

Rules for the report:

- Title & overview
  - Start with:
    # Security Summary - {time_range}
  - Write a 1-2 sentence situational overview capturing the general pattern of the period.

- Event details
  - Present events in chronological order as a bullet list.
  - **If multiple events occur within the same minute or overlapping time range, COMBINE them into a single bullet.**
    - Summarize the distinct activities as sub-points under the shared timestamp.
  - If no timestamp is given, preserve order but label as “Time not specified.”
  - Use bold timestamps for clarity.
  - Group bullets under subheadings when multiple events fall into the same category (e.g., Vehicle Activity, Porch Activity, Unusual Behavior).

- Threat levels
  - Always show the threat level for each event using these labels:
    - Threat level 0: "Normal"
    - Threat level 1: "Needs review"
    - Threat level 2: "Security concern"
  - Format as (threat level: Normal), (threat level: Needs review), or (threat level: Security concern).
  - If multiple events at the same time share the same threat level, only state it once.

- Final assessment
  - End with a Final Assessment section.
  - If all events are threat level 0:
    Final assessment: Only normal residential activity observed during this period.
  - If threat level 1 events are present:
    Final assessment: Some activity requires review but no security concerns identified.
  - If threat level 2 events are present, clearly summarize them as Security concerns requiring immediate attention.

- Conciseness
  - Do not repeat benign clothing/appearance details unless they distinguish individuals.
  - Summarize similar routine events instead of restating full scene descriptions.
