# webpack-dev-server

Use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides
live reloading. This should be used for **development only**.

It uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides
fast in-memory access to the webpack assets.

## Getting Started

First things first, install the module:

```console
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

or

```console
yarn add -D webpack-dev-server
```

or

```console
pnpm add -D webpack-dev-server
```

_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend
installing it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation
over a global one._

## Usage

There are two main, recommended methods of using the module:

### With the CLI

The easiest way to use it is with the [webpack CLI](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/). In the directory where your
`webpack.config.js` is, run:

```console
npx webpack serve
```

Following options are available with `webpack serve`:

```
Usage: webpack serve|server|s [entries...] [options]

Run the webpack dev server.

Options:
  -c, --config <value...>                             Provide path to a webpack configuration file e.g. ./webpack.config.js.

  --disable-interpret                                 Disable interpret for loading the config file.

### With NPM Scripts

NPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed
binaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a
script as such:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "webpack serve"
  }
}
```

And run the following in your terminal/console:

```console
npm run serve
```

NPM will automatically refer to the the binary in `node_modules` for you, and
execute the file or command.

### With the API

While it's recommended to run webpack-dev-server via the CLI, you may also choose to start a server via the API.

See the related [API documentation for `webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/api/webpack-dev-server/).

### With TypeScript

If you use TypeScript in the webpack config, you'll need to properly type `devServer` property in order to avoid TS errors (e.g. `'devServer' does not exist in type 'Configuration'`). For that use either:

```ts
/// <reference path="node_modules/webpack-dev-server/types/lib/Server.d.ts"/>
import type { Configuration } from "webpack";

// Your logic
```

Or you can import the type from `webpack-dev-server`, i.e.

```ts
import type { Configuration as DevServerConfiguration } from "webpack-dev-server";
import type { Configuration } from "webpack";

const devServer: DevServerConfiguration = {};
const config: Configuration = { devServer };

// module.exports
export default config;
```

### The Result

Either method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections
from `localhost` on port `8080`.

webpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as
you edit your assets while the server is running.

See [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.

## Browser Support

While `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5
state, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major
browsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky
browser out there.

If you find a bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a
Pull Request to resolve the bug.

## Support

We do our best to keep issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and
needed modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users
with general support, "how-to", or "why isn't this working" questions to try one
of the other support channels that are available.

Your first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should be the excellent
[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement
of those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a
pull request.

From there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack discussions][discussion-url] and
talk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,
head over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new
question. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your
`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!

If you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question
and someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.

If you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, or would like to see
a modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue
template isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it
out completely._
