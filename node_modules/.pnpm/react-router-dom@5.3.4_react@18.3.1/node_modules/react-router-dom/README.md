# react-router-dom

DOM bindings for [React Router](https://reactrouter.com).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-router-dom

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

// using CommonJS modules
const BrowserRouter = require("react-router-dom").BrowserRouter;
const Route = require("react-router-dom").Route;
const Link = require("react-router-dom").Link;
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-router-dom/umd/react-router-dom.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.ReactRouterDOM`.
