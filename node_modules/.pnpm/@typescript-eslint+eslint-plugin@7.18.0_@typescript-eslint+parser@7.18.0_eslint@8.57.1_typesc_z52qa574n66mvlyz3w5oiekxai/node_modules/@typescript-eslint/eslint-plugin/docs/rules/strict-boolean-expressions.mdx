Forbids usage of non-boolean types in expressions where a boolean is expected.
`boolean` and `never` types are always allowed.
Additional types which are considered safe in a boolean context can be configured via options.

The following nodes are considered boolean expressions and their type is checked:

- Argument to the logical negation operator (`!arg`).
- The condition in a conditional expression (`cond ? x : y`).
- Conditions for `if`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while` statements.
- Operands of logical binary operators (`lhs || rhs` and `lhs && rhs`).
  - Right-hand side operand is ignored when it's not a descendant of another boolean expression.
    This is to allow usage of boolean operators for their short-circuiting behavior.
- Asserted argument of an assertion function (`assert(arg)`).

## Examples

<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
// nullable numbers are considered unsafe by default
let num: number | undefined = 0;
if (num) {
  console.log('num is defined');
}

// nullable strings are considered unsafe by default
let str: string | null = null;
if (!str) {
  console.log('str is empty');
}

// nullable booleans are considered unsafe by default
function foo(bool?: boolean) {
  if (bool) {
    bar();
  }
}

// `any`, unconstrained generics and unions of more than one primitive type are disallowed
const foo = <T>(arg: T) => (arg ? 1 : 0);

// always-truthy and always-falsy types are disallowed
let obj = {};
while (obj) {
  obj = getObj();
}

// assertion functions without an `is` are boolean contexts.
declare function assert(value: unknown): asserts value;
let maybeString = Math.random() > 0.5 ? '' : undefined;
assert(maybeString);
```

<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```tsx
// nullable values should be checked explicitly against null or undefined
let num: number | undefined = 0;
if (num != null) {
  console.log('num is defined');
}

let str: string | null = null;
if (str != null && !str) {
  console.log('str is empty');
}

function foo(bool?: boolean) {
  if (bool ?? false) {
    bar();
  }
}

// `any` types should be cast to boolean explicitly
const foo = (arg: any) => (Boolean(arg) ? 1 : 0);
```

## Options

### `allowString`

Allows `string` in a boolean context.
This is safe because strings have only one falsy value (`""`).
Set this to `false` if you prefer the explicit `str != ""` or `str.length > 0` style.

### `allowNumber`

Allows `number` in a boolean context.
This is safe because numbers have only two falsy values (`0` and `NaN`).
Set this to `false` if you prefer the explicit `num != 0` and `!Number.isNaN(num)` style.

### `allowNullableObject`

Allows `object | function | symbol | null | undefined` in a boolean context.
This is safe because objects, functions and symbols don't have falsy values.
Set this to `false` if you prefer the explicit `obj != null` style.

### `allowNullableBoolean`

Allows `boolean | null | undefined` in a boolean context.
This is unsafe because nullable booleans can be either `false` or nullish.
Set this to `false` if you want to enforce explicit `bool ?? false` or `bool ?? true` style.
Set this to `true` if you don't mind implicitly treating false the same as a nullish value.

### `allowNullableString`

Allows `string | null | undefined` in a boolean context.
This is unsafe because nullable strings can be either an empty string or nullish.
Set this to `true` if you don't mind implicitly treating an empty string the same as a nullish value.

### `allowNullableNumber`

Allows `number | null | undefined` in a boolean context.
This is unsafe because nullable numbers can be either a falsy number or nullish.
Set this to `true` if you don't mind implicitly treating zero or NaN the same as a nullish value.

### `allowNullableEnum`

Allows `enum | null | undefined` in a boolean context.
This is unsafe because nullable enums can be either a falsy number or nullish.
Set this to `true` if you don't mind implicitly treating an enum whose value is zero the same as a nullish value.

### `allowAny`

Allows `any` in a boolean context.
This is unsafe for obvious reasons.
Set this to `true` at your own risk.

### `allowRuleToRunWithoutStrictNullChecksIKnowWhatIAmDoing`

If this is set to `false`, then the rule will error on every file whose `tsconfig.json` does _not_ have the `strictNullChecks` compiler option (or `strict`) set to `true`.

Without `strictNullChecks`, TypeScript essentially erases `undefined` and `null` from the types. This means when this rule inspects the types from a variable, **it will not be able to tell that the variable might be `null` or `undefined`**, which essentially makes this rule a lot less useful.

You should be using `strictNullChecks` to ensure complete type-safety in your codebase.

If for some reason you cannot turn on `strictNullChecks`, but still want to use this rule - you can use this option to allow it - but know that the behavior of this rule is _undefined_ with the compiler option turned off. We will not accept bug reports if you are using this option.

## Fixes and Suggestions

This rule provides following fixes and suggestions for particular types in boolean context:

- `boolean` - Always allowed - no fix needed.
- `string` - (when `allowString` is `false`) - Provides following suggestions:
  - Change condition to check string's length (`str` → `str.length > 0`)
  - Change condition to check for empty string (`str` → `str !== ""`)
  - Explicitly cast value to a boolean (`str` → `Boolean(str)`)
- `number` - (when `allowNumber` is `false`):
  - For `array.length` - Provides **autofix**:
    - Change condition to check for 0 (`array.length` → `array.length > 0`)
  - For other number values - Provides following suggestions:
    - Change condition to check for 0 (`num` → `num !== 0`)
    - Change condition to check for NaN (`num` → `!Number.isNaN(num)`)
    - Explicitly cast value to a boolean (`num` → `Boolean(num)`)
- `object | null | undefined` - (when `allowNullableObject` is `false`) - Provides **autofix**:
  - Change condition to check for null/undefined (`maybeObj` → `maybeObj != null`)
- `boolean | null | undefined` - Provides following suggestions:
  - Explicitly treat nullish value the same as false (`maybeBool` → `maybeBool ?? false`)
  - Change condition to check for true/false (`maybeBool` → `maybeBool === true`)
- `string | null | undefined` - Provides following suggestions:
  - Change condition to check for null/undefined (`maybeStr` → `maybeStr != null`)
  - Explicitly treat nullish value the same as an empty string (`maybeStr` → `maybeStr ?? ""`)
  - Explicitly cast value to a boolean (`maybeStr` → `Boolean(maybeStr)`)
- `number | null | undefined` - Provides following suggestions:
  - Change condition to check for null/undefined (`maybeNum` → `maybeNum != null`)
  - Explicitly treat nullish value the same as 0 (`maybeNum` → `maybeNum ?? 0`)
  - Explicitly cast value to a boolean (`maybeNum` → `Boolean(maybeNum)`)
- `any` and `unknown` - Provides following suggestions:
  - Explicitly cast value to a boolean (`value` → `Boolean(value)`)

## When Not To Use It

If your project isn't likely to experience bugs from falsy non-boolean values being used in logical conditions, you can skip enabling this rule.

Otherwise, this rule can be quite strict around requiring exact comparisons in logical checks.
If you prefer more succinct checks over more precise boolean logic, this rule might not be for you.
