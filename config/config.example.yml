    ## Optional mask. Must be the same dimensions as your video feed.
    ## The mask works by looking at the bottom center of the bounding box for the detected
    ## person in the image. If that pixel in the mask is a black pixel, it ignores it as a
    ## false positive. In my mask, the grass and driveway visible from my backdoor camera 
    ## are white. The garage doors, sky, and trees (anywhere it would be impossible for a 
    ## person to stand) are black.

    # Allows you to limit the framerate within frigate for cameras that do not support
    # custom framerates. A value of 1 tells frigate to look at every frame, 2 every 2nd frame,

    # parameters work for your specific hardware. These may work for those with Intel hardware that
