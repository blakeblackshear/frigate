Being open source, others have the possibility to modify and extend the rich functionality Frigate already offers.
This page is meant to be an overview over additions one can make to the home NVR setup. The list is not exhaustive and can be extended via PR to the Frigate docs. Most of these services are designed to interface with Frigate's unauthenticated api over port 5000.
