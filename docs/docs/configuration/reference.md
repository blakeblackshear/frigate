    interval: 50
    # Optional: Number of frames without a position change for an object to be considered stationary (default: 10x the frame rate or 10s)
    threshold: 50
    # Optional: Define a maximum number of frames for tracking a stationary object (default: not set, track forever)
    # This can help with false positives for objects that should only be stationary for a limited amount of time.
    # It can also be used to disable stationary object tracking. For example, you may want to set a value for person, but leave
    # car at the default.
    # WARNING: Setting these values overrides default behavior and disables stationary object tracking.
    #          There are very few situations where you would want it disabled. It is NOT recommended to

  # Optional: Milliseconds to offset detect annotations by (default: shown below).
  # There can often be latency between a recording and the detect process,
  # especially when using separate streams for detect and record.
  # Use this setting to make the timeline bounding boxes more closely align
  # with the recording. The value can be positive or negative.
  # TIP: Imagine there is an event clip with a person walking from left to right.
  #      If the event timeline bounding box is consistently to the left of the person
  #      then the value should be decreased. Similarly, if a person is walking from
  #      left to right and the bounding box is consistently ahead of the person
  #      then the value should be increased.
  # TIP: This offset is dynamic so you can change the value and it will update existing
  #      events, this makes it easy to tune.
  # WARNING: Fast moving objects will likely not have the bounding box align.
  annotation_offset: 0

  threshold: 30
  # Optional: The percentage of the image used to detect lightning or other substantial changes where motion detection
  #           needs to recalibrate. (default: shown below)
  # Increasing this value will make motion detection more likely to consider lightning or ir mode changes as valid motion.
  # Decreasing this value will make motion detection more likely to ignore large amounts of motion such as a person approaching
  # a doorbell camera.
  lightning_threshold: 0.8
  # Optional: Minimum size in pixels in the resized motion image that counts as motion (default: shown below)
  # Increasing this value will prevent smaller areas of motion from being detected. Decreasing will
  # make motion detection more sensitive to smaller moving objects.
  # As a rule of thumb:
  #  - 10 - high sensitivity
  #  - 30 - medium sensitivity
  #  - 50 - low sensitivity
  contour_area: 10
  # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging frames to determine the background (default: shown below)
  # Higher values mean the current frame impacts the average a lot, and a new object will be averaged into the background faster.

  frame_alpha: 0.01
  # Optional: Height of the resized motion frame  (default: 100)

  mqtt_off_delay: 30

# Optional: Record configuration

    # NOTE: this mode only applies when the days setting above is greater than 0
    mode: all
  # Optional: Recording Export Settings
  export:
    # Optional: Timelapse Output Args (default: shown below).
    # NOTE: The default args are set to fit 24 hours of recording into 1 hour playback.
    # See https://stackoverflow.com/a/58268695 for more info on how these args work.
    # As an example: if you wanted to go from 24 hours to 30 minutes that would be going
    # from 86400 seconds to 1800 seconds which would be 1800 / 86400 = 0.02.
    # The -r (framerate) dictates how smooth the output video is.
    # So the args would be -vf setpts=0.02*PTS -r 30 in that case.

      #
      # NOTE: If the retain mode for the camera is more restrictive than the mode configured
      #       here, the segments will already be gone by the time this mode is applied.
      #       For example, if the camera retain mode is "motion", the segments without motion are
      #       never stored, so setting the mode to "all" here won't bring them back.
