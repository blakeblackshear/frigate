title: Installing Frigate App
---

Frigate supports being installed as a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps) on Desktop, Android, and iOS.

This adds features including the ability to deep link directly into the app.

## Requirements

In order to install Frigate as a PWA, the following requirements must be met:

- Frigate must be accessed via a secure context (localhost, secure https, VPN, etc.)
- On Android, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Samsung Internet Browser all support installing PWAs.
- On iOS 16.4 and later, PWAs can be installed from the Share menu in Safari, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Orion.

## Installation

Installation varies slightly based on the device that is being used:

- Desktop: Use the install button typically found in right edge of the address bar
- Android: Use the `Install as App` button in the more options menu for Chrome, and the `Add app to Home screen` button for Firefox
- iOS: Use the `Add to Homescreen` button in the share menu

## Usage

Once setup, the Frigate app can be used wherever it has access to Frigate. This means it can be setup as local-only, VPN-only, or fully accessible depending on your needs.
