import labels from "../../../labelmap.txt";

By default, Frigate includes the following object models from the Google Coral test data.

<ul>
  {labels.split("\n").map((label) => (
    <li>{label.replace(/^\d+\s+/, "")}</li>
  ))}
</ul>

## Custom Models

Models for both CPU and EdgeTPU (Coral) are bundled in the image. You can use your own models with volume mounts:

- CPU Model: `/cpu_model.tflite`
- EdgeTPU Model: `/edgetpu_model.tflite`
- Labels: `/labelmap.txt`

You also need to update the model width/height in the config if they differ from the defaults.
