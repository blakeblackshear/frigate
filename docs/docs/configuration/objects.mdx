import labels from '../../../labelmap.txt';

By default, Frigate includes the following object models from the Google Coral test data.

<ul>
  {labels.split('\n').map((label) => (
    <li>{label.replace(/^\d+\s+/, '')}</li>
  ))}
</ul>

## Custom Models

Models for both CPU and EdgeTPU (Coral) are bundled in the image. You can use your own models with volume mounts:

- CPU Model: `/cpu_model.tflite`
- EdgeTPU Model: `/edgetpu_model.tflite`
- Labels: `/labelmap.txt`

You also need to update the model width/height in the config if they differ from the defaults.

### Customizing the Labelmap

The labelmap can be customized to your needs. A common reason to do this is to combine multiple object types that are easily confused when you don't need to be as granular such as car/truck. You must retain the same number of labels, but you can change the names. To change:

- Download the [COCO labelmap](https://dl.google.com/coral/canned_models/coco_labels.txt)
- Modify the label names as desired. For example, change `7 truck` to `7 car`
- Mount the new file at `/labelmap.txt` in the container with an additional volume
  ```
  -v ./config/labelmap.txt:/labelmap.txt
  ```
