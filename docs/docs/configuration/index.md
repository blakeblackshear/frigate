title: Configuration File
---

For Home Assistant Addon installations, the config file needs to be in the root of your Home Assistant config directory (same location as `configuration.yaml`) and named `frigate.yml`.

For all other installation types, the config file should be mapped to `/config/config.yml` inside the container.

It is recommended to start with a minimal configuration and add to it as described in [this guide](/guides/getting_started):

```yaml
mqtt:
  host: mqtt.server.com
cameras:
  back:
    ffmpeg:
      inputs:
        - path: rtsp://viewer:{FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD}@10.0.10.10:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=2
          roles:
            - detect
            - rtmp
    detect:
      width: 1280
      height: 720
```

### VSCode Configuration Schema

VSCode (and VSCode addon) supports the JSON schemas which will automatically validate the config. This can be added by adding `# yaml-language-server: $schema=http://frigate_host:5000/api/config/schema` to the top of the config file. `frigate_host` being the IP address of frigate or `ccab4aaf-frigate` if running in the addon.

### Full configuration reference:

:::caution

It is not recommended to copy this full configuration file. Only specify values that are different from the defaults. Configuration options and default values may change in future versions.

    threshold: 50
    # Optional: Define a maximum number of frames for tracking a stationary object (default: not set, track forever)
    # This can help with false positives for objects that should only be stationary for a limited amount of time.
    # It can also be used to disable stationary object tracking. For example, you may want to set a value for person, but leave
    # car at the default.
    # WARNING: Setting these values overrides default behavior and disables stationary object tracking.
    #          There are very few situations where you would want it disabled. It is NOT recommended to

# NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
motion:
  # Optional: The threshold passed to cv2.threshold to determine if a pixel is different enough to be counted as motion. (default: shown below)
  # Increasing this value will make motion detection less sensitive and decreasing it will make motion detection more sensitive.
  # The value should be between 1 and 255.
  threshold: 25
  # Optional: Minimum size in pixels in the resized motion image that counts as motion (default: 30)
  # Increasing this value will prevent smaller areas of motion from being detected. Decreasing will

  # As a rule of thumb:
  #  - 15 - high sensitivity
  #  - 30 - medium sensitivity
  #  - 50 - low sensitivity
  contour_area: 30
  # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging the motion delta across multiple frames (default: shown below)
  # Higher values mean the current frame impacts the delta a lot, and a single raindrop may register as motion.
  # Too low and a fast moving person wont be detected as motion.
  delta_alpha: 0.2
  # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging frames to determine the background (default: shown below)
  # Higher values mean the current frame impacts the average a lot, and a new object will be averaged into the background faster.
  # Low values will cause things like moving shadows to be detected as motion for longer.
  # https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/background-subtraction-in-an-image-using-concept-of-running-average/
  frame_alpha: 0.2
  # Optional: Height of the resized motion frame  (default: 50)
  # This operates as an efficient blur alternative. Higher values will result in more granular motion detection at the expense
  # of higher CPU usage. Lower values result in less CPU, but small changes may not register as motion.

  # NOTE: see docs for more detailed info on creating masks
  mask: 0,900,1080,900,1080,1920,0,1920

  # for daytime.

record:
  # Optional: Enable recording (default: shown below)
  # WARNING: If recording is disabled in the config, turning it on via

  #          on available disk space automatically. If using recordings,
  #          you must specify retention settings for a number of days that

      # NOTE: If the retain mode for the camera is more restrictive than the mode configured
      #       here, the segments will already be gone by the time this mode is applied.
      #       For example, if the camera retain mode is "motion", the segments without motion are
