title: Frigate Configuration
---

For Home Assistant Addon installations, the config file needs to be in the root of your Home Assistant config directory (same location as `configuration.yaml`). It can be named `frigate.yaml` or `frigate.yml`, but if both files exist `frigate.yaml` will be preferred and `frigate.yml` will be ignored.

For all other installation types, the config file should be mapped to `/config/config.yml` inside the container.

It is recommended to start with a minimal configuration and add to it as described in [this guide](../guides/getting_started.md) and use the built in configuration editor in Frigate's UI which supports validation.

```yaml
mqtt:
  enabled: False

cameras:
  dummy_camera: # <--- this will be changed to your actual camera later
    enabled: False
    ffmpeg:
      inputs:
        - path: rtsp://127.0.0.1:554/rtsp
          roles:
            - detect
```

## VSCode Configuration Schema

VSCode supports JSON schemas for automatically validating configuration files. You can enable this feature by adding `# yaml-language-server: $schema=http://frigate_host:5000/api/config/schema.json` to the beginning of the configuration file. Replace `frigate_host` with the IP address or hostname of your Frigate server. If you're using both VSCode and Frigate as an add-on, you should use `ccab4aaf-frigate` instead. Make sure to expose the internal unauthenticated port `5000` when accessing the config from VSCode on another machine.

## Environment Variable Substitution

Frigate supports the use of environment variables starting with `FRIGATE_` **only** where specifically indicated in the [reference config](./reference.md). For example, the following values can be replaced at runtime by using environment variables:

```yaml
mqtt:
  user: "{FRIGATE_MQTT_USER}"
  password: "{FRIGATE_MQTT_PASSWORD}"
```

```yaml
- path: rtsp://{FRIGATE_RTSP_USER}:{FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD}@10.0.10.10:8554/unicast
```

```yaml
onvif:
  host: 10.0.10.10
  port: 8000
  user: "{FRIGATE_RTSP_USER}"
  password: "{FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD}"
```

```yaml
go2rtc:
  rtsp:
    username: "{FRIGATE_GO2RTC_RTSP_USERNAME}"
    password: "{FRIGATE_GO2RTC_RTSP_PASSWORD}"
```

## Common configuration examples

Here are some common starter configuration examples. Refer to the [reference config](./reference.md) for detailed information about all the config values.

### Raspberry Pi Home Assistant Addon with USB Coral

- Single camera with 720p, 5fps stream for detect
- MQTT connected to home assistant mosquitto addon
- Hardware acceleration for decoding video
- USB Coral detector
- Save all video with any detectable motion for 7 days regardless of whether any objects were detected or not
- Continue to keep all video if it was during any event for 30 days
- Save snapshots for 30 days
- Motion mask for the camera timestamp
