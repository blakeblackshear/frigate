[Snapshots](../configuration/snapshots.md) and/or [Recordings](../configuration/record.md) must be enabled for events to be created for detected objects.

The best way to limit events to areas of interest is to use [zones](../configuration/zones.md) along with `required_zones` for events and snapshots to only have events created in areas of interest.
